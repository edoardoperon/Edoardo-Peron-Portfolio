# [Project 1: Segment Analysis through SQL](https://edoardoperon.github.io/Segment_Analysis_through_SQL/)

In this project, I designed and created a database similar to what a simplified Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) might be. I wanted to segment customers by distribution channel and extrapolate some business data (such as the operating margin by distribution channel).

With this project I wanted to demonstrate my ability to:
- Understand the logic of a database
- Use basic (sum, extract, order by, etc.) and intermediate (pivoting, case/when, cast, inner join, group by, etc.) commands to extract data from a database

The tools I used for the project are PostgresSQL and Excel.

Operating margin by distribution channel:

| distribution channel | 2020 |2021|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| small |20783| 5791 |
| medium |30362| 14501 |
| large |2765| 4535 |
