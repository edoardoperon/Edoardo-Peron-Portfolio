# Project 1: Segment Analysis through SQL

In this project, I designed and created a database similar to what a simplified corporate ERP might be. I wanted to segment customers by distribution channel and extrapolate data.

With this project I wanted to demonstrate my ability to:
- Understand the logic of a database
- Use basic and intermediate commands to extract data from a database

The tool I used for the project is PostgresSQL.
